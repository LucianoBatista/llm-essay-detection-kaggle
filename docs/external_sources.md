The objective here is to describe any external public available source of essay, that can be used on the competition.

Important note, there is a `persuade` corpus, this is public, and seems that the competition is using the 2 and 12 prompts from this corpus, to give to students to write an essay.

More info about it:

# LLM Generated Essays for the Detect AI Comp

- 500 generated by the gpt-3.5-turbo

Those prompt ids, seems to be from the competition.

# ArguGPT

ArguGPT is a balanced corpus of 4,038 argumentative essays generated by 7 GPT models in response to essay prompts from three sources:

1. in-class or homework exercises
2. TOEFL
3. GRE writing tasks.

Those models was not identified, the paper says the following:

> _...seven models of the GPT family (GPT2-XL, variants of GPT3, and ChatGPT)_

One important observation is that the paper also evaluate human written text, but I couldn't find those texts.

I'll link to paper, very useful information there:

# DAIGT | External Dataset

I'm using just the AI generated part of the dataset. This dataset also has a column of student written essays, but it is a bit confusing about how this is structure. This dataset was generated by using chatgpt.

# DAIGT Data | Llama 70b and Falcon 180b

8K of generated essays each from Llama 70b and Falcon 180b.

There is different csvs, and the prompts were from the PERSUADE database and from GPT-4.

# LLM-generated essay using PaLM from Google Gen-AI

This database is simple, but I think that is interesting to use, because is using those `prompt_id`s from the original training dataset of the competition.

One downside is that the prompt id can be limited to training dataset. As the competition says that we have 7 prompts in total, add some others prompts to the training data can be interesting.

# Hello, Claude! 1000 Essays from 7 Persuade prompts

Basically as used the `claude-instant-1` model, using all prompts from PERSUADE dataset. We have essays from those two prompts on the training data, but also about the other prompts.

# Persuade Corpus 2.0

This dataset has aprox. 26k essays, from all the 7 Prompts that probably exist on the competition. And all data was written by a human. I thinks this could help to the model abstract better to the leaderboard score.

# DAIGT Proper Train Dataset

This dataset is not very much explained about the difference between all those versions of csvs. But I'm using just two csvs that have data generated by **Mistral**.

I opt for that because **Mistral** was not very used on above showed datasets.

# Feedback Prize 3

As we are evaluating if the essay was written by a person or not, may have more data outside those prompts could help. This dataset is from the Feedback Prize 3 Kaggle Competition, offered by the same lab (The Learning Agency Lab), and contains just essays written by students (about 3911 essays).

# :exclamation: Important

**Search if there is human written essays using some of the 7 PERSUADE prompts!**
